Here's a sample `README.md` for your text summarization project on GitHub:

# Text Summarization Web App

This is a Flask-based web application designed to summarize large bodies of text in both **English** and **Hindi**. The app uses **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques, including **NLTK** and custom algorithms, to generate concise and meaningful summaries. The application features a simple and user-friendly interface, allowing users to quickly extract key information from lengthy texts.

## Features
- **Text Summarization in English and Hindi:** Summarizes long paragraphs in both languages with ease.
- **NLP Techniques:** Uses advanced NLP methods, including NLTK for tokenization and sentence segmentation, along with custom summarization algorithms.
- **Simple User Interface:** Intuitive, clean, and easy-to-use design for quick text input and summarization.
- **Customizable Summaries:** Users can choose the length or type of summary they need.

## Technologies Used
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript for a responsive user interface.
- **Backend:** Flask for building the web app and handling requests.
- **NLP Libraries:** 
  - [NLTK](https://www.nltk.org/) for tokenization, stopwords removal, and text processing.
  - Custom summarization algorithms for content extraction.
- **Database:** (If applicable) No database is used as this is a text-processing app, but could be extended for saving summaries.
  
## Installation

To run the app locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/shoob-cyber/text_summarization.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project folder:**
   ```bash
   cd text_summarization
   ```

3. **Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   ```

4. **Activate the virtual environment:**
   - On Windows:
     ```bash
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - On macOS/Linux:
     ```bash
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

5. **Install the required dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

6. **Run the Flask app:**
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

7. **Access the app:**  
   Open your browser and navigate to {Ex -[http://127.0.0.1:5000/](http://127.0.0.1:5000/)} to start using the text summarization tool.

## Usage
1. Open the web app in your browser.
2. Enter the text you want to summarize in the input field.
3. Choose the desired language (English or Hindi).
4. Click the "Summarize" button to get the summary of the input text.
5. View the concise summary generated by the app.
